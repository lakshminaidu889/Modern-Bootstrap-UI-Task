## 3. Component Remixing: The Footer

- **Design Choice:** Implemented a fixed dark footer (`bg-dark`) for a strong, professional contrast against the light pages.
- **Utility Use:** Utilized Bootstrap's `row` and `col` classes to ensure responsive layout, putting copyright information on the left and navigation links on the right for desktop views.
- Added necessary quick links and a copyright notice for corporate polish.
